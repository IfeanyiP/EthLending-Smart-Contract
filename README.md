# EthLending-Smart-Contract
Our smart contract acts as an autonomous digital vault, allowing users to lend ETH to a common pool and others to borrow from it by providing ERC20 tokens as collateral. The entire process is governed by code, not by a corporation, ensuring fairness and security for all participants.
